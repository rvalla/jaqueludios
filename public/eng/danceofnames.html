			<h2>introductionn</h2>
			<p><b>Dance of names</b> is the first <b>jaqueludio</b>. An stochastic prelude based on chess games for a group
				of people. A little tribute for men and women who have played the best chess during its long history. This
				is a game designed for a group of at least 32 people, although ideally they must be more than 64.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box blue">
			<h2>a game</h2>
			<p>The only section of the piece is controlled with a chess game. All the players need to be able to see the board
				in which the choosen game is reproduced. The selection of the game is completely free. I recommend to choose
				beautiful and interesting games, although bad games sound the same probably.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box green">
			<h2>time</h2>
			<p>A <b>Dance of names</b> lasts more or less 90 seconds. The choosen chess game is divided into a series of
				positions (between 40 and 50). Each position must be fixed during about 2 seconds. So, if the
				choosen game has 24 moves there can be a board position for each move while if the game has 70 moves it
				need to be compressed.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box blue">
			<h2>cards</h2>
			<p>Before the begining of a pieace, each player needs a card. A card has a name (from a chess player) and a
				chess piece.</p>
			<img src="../assets/img/cards_set2.jpg" />
    </div>
		<div class="box red">
			<h2>your card</h2>
			<p>Here your device chose a card for you. Don't believe me? Try to reload the page.</p>
				<img src="" id="card" />
    </div>
		<div class="box green">
			<h2>a melody</h2>
			<p>Each player compose a brief melody using sounds from the card's name. Sounds which are not part of the name
				can't be used. The melody must last less than 4 seconds.</p>
			<p>Carlsen: carl-sen-sen<br>
				Polgar: <strike>olé-olé</strike> pol-gar<br>
				Kasparov: kas-pa-pa-kas</p>
    </div>
		<div class="box red">
			<h2>silence</h2>
			<p>When they see the board with the initial position, all players make silence. That's the moment to
				choose a piece of the type indicated on the card (a white pawn, a black bishop, the white queen). The player
				must follow the choosen piece during all the game.</p>
				<img src="../assets/img/start_board.png" />
    </div>
		<div class="box blue">
			<h2>the start</h2>
			<p>At the first move, all players start singing their melody, with medium intensity (neither too loud nor too soft).
				They repeat it continuously during the whole game. They can make variations to the melody if they get bored.</p>
				<img src="../assets/img/first_move.png" />
    </div>
		<div class="box red">
			<h2>changes</h2>
			<p>It may happen that the piece a player is following is captured. In that case, the player will continue singing
			but with a ghost voice (whispering).</p>
			<p>In addition, each time a player's piece moves, must clap once (make a noise with both hands).</p>
			<p>The prelude ends with the image of an empty chess board. In that moment, the players stop singing.</p>
			<p>Ovation is permitted.</p>
    </div>
		<div class="box green">
			<h2>evaluation</h2>
			<p>While following his piece on the board, the player can evaluate the position of the game. If he considers that
				his color has the advantage, he will sing louder. If he senses that his color is at a disadvantage, he will sing
				softer. The greater the advantage (or disadvantage) the greater the change in intensity.</p>
				<p>Those players who take their role very seriously can study the chosen game with the help of a chess engine.
					I recommend using a <a target="_blank" href="https://lichess.org/study">Lichess study.</a></p>

			<h2>premiere</h2>
			<p>As usual, the first versions of <b>Dance of names</b> sounded in the
				<a target="_blank" href="http://festivaldelingenio.com.ar">13<sup>er</sup> Festival del ingenio</a> at the
				<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ccdelaciencia">Centro Cultural de la Ciencia</a>.</p>
			<p>You can see the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/VJB_F9mMtdY">video</a> which immortalizes that
				moment on the festival channel. It includes the explanation of the game and the very brief rehearsals. It all
				happened in 15 minutes. You can listen to the music right here.</p>

			<h2>materials</h2>
			<p>If you want to produce a version of <b>Dance of names</b> you can use the software I made to
			transform a chess game in <i>pgn</i> format in a series of <i>png</i> images.
			It is written in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and use the library
			<a target="_blank" href="https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/">python-chess</a>. You can find it at
			<a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/azarte/jaqueludios/-/tree/themoststable/tools">gitlab</a>.</p>
			<p>If you want to print a set of cards you can download the A3 file
			<a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/azarte/jaqueludios/-/tree/themoststable/assets/svg">here</a>.
			If you don't want to print anything you can simply ask the players to look for a virtual card using
			<a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/jaquecarta">this link</a>.
