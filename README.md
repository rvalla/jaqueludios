### what is **jaqueludios**?

**jaqueludios** is a series of stochastic musical preludes which are a game at the same time. Games for
players without any musical training. Is part of a family of works which started with
[The butterfly and its chaotic effect](https://vimeo.com/rodrigovalla/chaoticbutterfly) and,
until 2021, ended with [infectoDoppler](https://azarte.gitlab.io/infectodoppler/).  

## standing upon the shoulders of giants

This little project is possible thanks to a lot of work done by others in the *open-source* community. Particularly in
this case I need to mention:

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): one of the programming languages I used.  
- [**python-chess**](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess): the library which helps me to process chess moves.  
- [**Lichess**](https://lichess.org): the site where I play, learn and find inspiration. This project wouldn't be
possible without the best site to play and learn chess.
